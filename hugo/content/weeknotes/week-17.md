**Protecting liberty by simplifying security**

_Recap_: We're building Fluidkeys to make it easy for teams to implement great security across their organisations. Weâ€™ve built a command line app that helps you make strong PGP keys and automatically rotate them.

Paulâ€™s back from his holiday, but Iâ€™ve not managed to stop him coding for long enough to write these. Sorry, me again.

## The short version:
* Weâ€™ve built a dashboard to hold ourselves to account
* Weâ€™ve decided to prioritise building a way to send a secrets to someone, rather than setup your team with PGP keys
* Weâ€™re scheduling chats with people to learn more about their infosec woes

## A dashboard to help us focus
This week we spent two days designing and building a dashboard that we now proudly display on our desks in our respective cities. Hereâ€™s Paulâ€™s in Liverpool:

The theory is that by tracking some key numbers, weâ€™ll improve! Firstly, weâ€™re measuring the number of people signing up to our release notes, hopefully by looking at this every day weâ€™ll then start to prioritise work to increase it. Currently itâ€™s one every few days, most of this coming from [Expirybot](https://www.expirybot.com/). Next, we want to speak to at least 4 people every week, so next weekâ€™s looking good! We want to do a minor release every 30 days, so not so great there. And then ultimately weâ€™re trying to make a living out of this. As you can see, thereâ€™s still some room for improvement.

If week notes arenâ€™t regular enough for you, now you can follow along with our progress in realtime: [https://fluidkeys-dashboard.herokuapp.com](https://fluidkeys-dashboard.herokuapp.com)!

## Deciding to build a way to send secrets next ðŸ¤«
Today was a productive dayâ€¦

While weâ€™ve been thinking about how people using Fluidkeys invite others to join their team, and get keys synced and up to date, it isnâ€™t feeling like this proposition is valuable enough in and of itself.

We revisited our notes from our research and pulled out some of the pains theyâ€™re feeling:

> I hate to think how much [sensitive information] stuff gets sent around Slack!

> We use a shared services@[â€¦] google inbox/group to manage access to AWS, it works, but itâ€™s a pain to setup andâ€¦ itâ€™s Google!

> Itâ€™s hard getting new developers to setup PGP to receive login credentials

Weâ€™ve decided to address these next. With Fluidkeys you can send secret snippets to your team-mates. They'll be end-to-end encrypted, so safe from any prying eyes and data-breaches.

Some of the things weâ€™ve heard people are nervous pinging around are:

* customer personal identifiable information to colleagues when helping with technical debugging
* API login credentials with a developer outside the team
* database dumps
* keys for servers when developers join the project

Our MVP will focus on letting you send small snippets:

<pre class="terminal">
<span class="prompt">âžœ</span> fk secret send ian@fluidkeys.com

[type or paste your message, ending by typing Ctrl-D]

<span class="information">SECRET_ACCESS_TOKEN="7d10c9b8-f48e-11e8-9b90-a74f356d2ad5"</span>

 â–¸ Searching for a public key for ian@fluidkeys.com... [<span class="positive">found</span>]
 <span class="positive">â–¸ Successfully sent secret to ian@fluidkeys.com</span>

<span class="prompt">âžœ</span>
</pre>

## Next week weâ€™ll see if weâ€™re closer to the mark
As you can see, weâ€™ve five calls lined up next week with people either using PGP in their organisations or interested in it. Again weâ€™re going to use those calls to try to understand what sorts of pains theyâ€™re feeling and what how their organisations are structured before trying to see if what weâ€™re building might be useful.

Tune in next week!
