**Protecting liberty by simplifying security**

*Recap*: We're building Fluidkeys to make it easy for teams to implement
great security across their organisations.

## This week

We've decided to pin the price of Fluidkeys to the size of team, not on features.

We also plan to offer it for free or discounted to eligible NGOs / open source projects.

We then interviewed 4 people about how their currently using PGP in their organisations.
We're still trying to learn whether there's value enough in Fluidkeys as a piece of
software that "just makes PGP work", or whether we need to make it do things like
configure Git or Thunderbird / Enigmail for you too.

To test this we used some screenshots of how this *could* look.

Here's how it could make using PGP in your team easier:

And here's some of the other things it might configure (like Git, or Email):

Next week, I'm going to turn those sketches into a revised landing page, and measure see what draws peoples attention.

## Want to test Fluidkeys in your team?

We've contacted a few teams to see if they're up for testing it with us
once it's ready in a few weeks.

What it'll do for you:

* Create a new best-practice key for anyone who doesn't have one

Then automatically:

* Suggest & fix issues with any existing keys
* Rotate everyone's encryption subkey each month (old encrypted data is accessible!)
* Synchronise public keys between team members
* Integrate with GnuPG so you can use Enigmail, Git signing, etc

Do you want a go? Let me know! ðŸ™Œ

See you next week!
