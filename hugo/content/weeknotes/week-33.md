_Recap_: Fluidkeys makes PGP simple for engineering teams. It helps you safeguard your source code and protect passwords, secrets and personal data.

## The short version

* we've more or less finished all the dev before Tuesday's release
* we're ready for FLOSS weekly on Wednesday

My turn to keep this short as we're against the clock today.

## Finished dev for Tuesday's release

We absolutely tore through our Trello cards this week and I can tell you we're both ready for
a break!

As a quick summary:

* You can create, invite and join teams
* Team keys are automatically fetched and kept up to date
* Team keys are trusted in GnuPG, making anything that uses GnuPG work out-the-box
* Our new `status` command which shows you a summary of your teams and keys

I took a step back this morning just to have a play and I felt... proud! I'm really pleased
with what we've achieved so far.

I'm excited to tell the world about it next week.

## We're ready for FLOSS weekly on Wednesday

We're appearing on the FLOSS weekly podcast next week. We timed it to coincide with our v1 release,
and we had a little bit of prep to do beforehand.

Mostly this was making decisions about some of the inevitable questions that'll be answered to
50,000 listeners...

[Tune in next week!](https://twit.tv/shows/floss-weekly)

## Next week

Next week we'll release on Tuesday and spend the rest of the week making some overdue materials
like videos and blog posts showing off what Fluidkeys can actually do.
As ever, if you’ve got any thoughts or feedback, we’re all ears.

Have a great weekend,

— Paul
