_Recap_: Fluidkeys makes PGP simple for engineering teams. It helps you safeguard your source code and protect passwords, secrets and personal data.

## The short version

* Weâ€™re back from the Internet Freedom Festival
* We practiced our pitch for funding - do you know someone we should be speaking to?
* Weâ€™ve been in touch with the teams using Fluidkeys
* Weâ€™ve begun building a way that people will receive emails helping them get setup

## Weâ€™re back from the Internet Freedom Festival
After spending last week at the [IFF](https://internetfreedomfestival.org/), and the previous weeks to that all been focused on the v1 release, this weekâ€™s been a bit of a tough one. Itâ€™s taken time to get back into thinking about Fluidkeys and to start build up momentum again. Itâ€™s nice to see teams beginning to use it, but Iâ€™d be lying if I said the worry hasnâ€™t crept in about whether what weâ€™re building is useful, whether it actually works and how weâ€™re going to reach people!

## Do you know someone we should be speaking to about investment?
On Wednesday we had a chance to practice our pitch for funding.  Itâ€™s a good reminder that there are many parts to building a successful enterprise: product, market, support, funding and that now is the right time to start talking to different funders (grants bodies, philanthropic individuals, foundations) about the future of our work.

To date, weâ€™ve invested Â£32,000 of our own cash, plus the same in kind. Weâ€™re starting to look for financial support now that will enable us to continue developing Fluidkeys for another year. In that year, weâ€™d anticipate improving the security of around 200 teams, and that enough of those teams will pay a subscription for us to become financially stable.

Do you know anyone we should we speaking to? The sorts of people I think would be good are those funders looking to promote a fairer, more respectful Internet. The sort of funders focusing on digital rights, privacy and security. Iâ€™d love to hear from you if you do!

## Weâ€™ve been speaking to the teams using Fluidkeys
Iâ€™m delighted to say that since launching the teams version weâ€™ve now half a dozen teams using Fluidkeys. This week we contacted them all to learn more about where they heard of us and what theyâ€™re using Fluidkeys for. Most of them heard about Fluidkeys from [our appearance on FLOSS Weekly](https://twit.tv/shows/floss-weekly/episodes/523?autostart=false). One person I spoke to this week suggested we might consider offering our server as an Amazon Machine Image, and make Fluidkeys available through the Amazon Marketplace. Itâ€™s an interesting idea. That way they wouldnâ€™t have to worry about paying for Fluidkeys, itâ€™d just get rolled into the companyâ€™s AWS subscription. Theyâ€™d also then be able to host that machine image within their virtual infrastructure, which sounded preferable than trusting us. Interestingâ€¦

## Weâ€™ve begun building a way that people will receive emails helping them get setup
Lastly, weâ€™ve spent Thursday and today starting to build a way to email the people whoâ€™ve started setting up Fluidkeys in the last couple of months. Thereâ€™re over a hundred of them. We want to make sure they know they can now make a team, and how to do that. Weâ€™ve opted to built a simple way to write different emails that will trigger at different places depending on what the individuals done with Fluidkeys.

And that brings me nearly onto next weekâ€™s goal: automatically email people who've verified an email but aren't in a team ðŸ¤–

Thatâ€™s it for now. Have a great weekend.
