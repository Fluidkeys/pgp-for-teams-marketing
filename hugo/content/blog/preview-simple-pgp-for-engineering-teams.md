We've made a [preview site to articulate what we're doing](/fluidkeys-v1-preview). We'd love your [feedback.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19044043)

## Background

Last month we showed how [Fluidkeys makes it simple to send encrypted secrets from the command line](/blog/release-0-3-send-encrypted-secrets/). Sending secrets is just the start. We're on bigger a mission to simplify security and help engineering teams adopt stronger software development practices.

The Hackernews discussion on v0.3 was extremely helpful. It became apparent that we weren't being clear about the bigger picture, so we've been working on that over the past week.

To illustrate this we've created a preview page for the upcoming release of Fluidkeys.

We'd love to hear what you think!

* Is it clear what Fluidkeys does?
* What do you think?
* What do you think it'd be worth to your team?

We're excited to hear from you :)
