# Our mission
We are building a future where companies respect their customers and users.

We do this by making it simple for them to adopt technology and practices that protect personal information.

We build beautifully simple security software for teams.

# We're (almost) a non-profit

We have an honest business model where companies pay us for the service we provide.

We're in the process of incorporating as a UK non-profit. This compels us to put our mission before profit. We believe this is a good way to keep ourselves honest to our mission.
