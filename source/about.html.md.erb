# Our mission
We are building a future where companies respect their customers and users.

We do this by making it simple for them to adopt technology and practices that protect personal information.

We build beautifully simple security software for teams.

# About us

[Paul](https://www.paulfurley.com/) and [Ian](https://twitter.com/idrysdale) keep themselves
busy fighting internet surveillance and censorship.

They run a [Tor node](https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#details/165FEA8476A02296DD8C6281CD02AC80319F8ACA)
and maintain [a bot that reminds you if your PGP key is about to expire](https://www.paulfurley.com/expirybot-emails-pgp-users-before-their-key-expires/)

Previously they’ve run [cryptoparties](https://digitalblog.coop.co.uk/2017/04/26/cryptoparty-a-fun-way-to-learn-about-security/)
at the UK’s largest consumer Co-op and helped setup [a gym that puts people’s physical energy to use in their local communities](https://www.goodgym.org/).
