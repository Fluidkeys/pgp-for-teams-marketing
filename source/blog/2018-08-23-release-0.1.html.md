# Announcing Fluidkeys v0.1!

Ian and I are extremely proud to announce the very first (extremely minimal) release of Fluidkeys.

We're building Fluidkeys to help teams protect themselves with strong encryption. Fluidkeys builds on the OpenPGP standard and is compatible with other OpenPGP software.

## Fluidkeys 0.1 helps you make a PGP key

This release of Fluidkeys is aimed at helping developers and sysadmins get started using PGP. (We're starting with technical folks but Fluidkeys will soon be for *everyone*.)

Once installed, run `fk` and it'll:

* Create a best-practice OpenPGP key
* Make a strong, memorable password and help you record it
* Import your new key into GnuPG so you can start using it
* Save a backup ZIP file of the whole key that you can restore from later

We'd love it if you [tried it out](https://github.com/fluidkeys/fluidkeys)

## What next?

We've got loads of ideas for v0.2, but we'd like to hear from you. Do any of these take your fancy?

* Automatically publish your newly generated key on the web in a nice to find format
* Email you an encrypted message for you to practice decrypting using your new key
* Automatically rotate and upgrade your keys
* Import your existing keys from GnuPG
* Test imported keys against best practice
* Setup GnuPG and Github for signed, verified commits
* Store your key backup and password in 1Password or LastPass

Or something else?

## Stay up to date

We're writing weeknotes at [fluidkeys.com/blog](https://www.fluidkeys.com/blog) (available as [RSS/atom](https://www.fluidkeys.com/blog/feed.xml)).
